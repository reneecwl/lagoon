# Project Title
Lagoon: Your Travel Planner üåç‚úàÔ∏è

## Overview

Tired of juggling multiple tabs to plan your trips?

Lagoon simplifies the process by integrating weather forecasts, public holidays, and activity suggestions into a single, intuitive platform.

### Problem Space

Planning a trip often requires juggling multiple websites or apps to check weather forecasts, public holidays, and activity options, leading to a fragmented and time-consuming experience. Lagoon addresses this pain point by consolidating essential travel planning information into a single, user-friendly interface, reducing the need for multiple tabs and streamlining the process.

### User Profile

Key User Stories:

- üß≥ As a traveller, I want to plan my trip in one place so that I don‚Äôt have to switch between multiple tabs.

- üß≥ As a traveller, I want to be able to revisit my itinerary and resume planning later.

### Features

- Trip Input: Users input location, travel dates, days and user name on the Homepage; submitting creates an initial itinerary with weather and holiday data.

- Trip Planning: Users add the itinerary_name, browse curated attractions and add them to their itinerary, updating the saved plan.

- Itinerary Builder: Users can view all their itineraries in one page, allowing them to add new itinerary or click the itinerary and route back to the planning page.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

- Frontend: ‚öõÔ∏è React (React Router, Axios, React-Datepicker, React-Responsive)

- Backend: üñ•Ô∏è Express.js (Node.js framework) üì¶ Knex.js (SQL query builder)

- Database: üóÑÔ∏è MySQL

Optional Features: üñ±Ô∏è React-Draggable (Drag-and-drop activity planning) üìä React-ChartJS-2 (Weather data visualization)

### APIs

- External:

2. **Nager.Date**: Fetches public holiday data by year and country (e.g., GET /PublicHolidays/{year}/{countryCode}).
3. **Google Places API (Stretch)**: Enhances location search with autocomplete (optional).

## Roadmap

Week 1

- Set up project (React frontend, Express backend, MySQL database, Knex config).
- Build Homepage with form; implement POST /api/itineraries to create an initial itinerary
- Integrate OpenWeatherMap and Nager.Date APIs; seed attractions with London data.
- Create Trip Planning Page to display weather, holidays, and attractions; add PATCH /api/itineraries/:id to update attractions.
- Build Itinerary Page to show the saved plan; test GET /api/itineraries/:id.

Week 2

- Add responsiveness
- Test API endpoints and fix bugs.
- Polish UI (e.g., activity cards, weather display); add Sydney attractions if time allows.
- Final testing and documentation.
- Demo Day

## Future Implementations

Login Page: Allows users to log in or register to save itineraries.

Collaboration: Logged-in users can invite friends to view/edit itineraries and share plans.

Travel Style incorporated in Homepage question (e.g., "chill" vs. "packed") to auto-suggest attractions using AI (e.g., Open AI integration).

Social Features: Like/comment function on attractions, showing popularity among friends to help with the planning process.

Travel Details: Link flight and hotel booking APIs (e.g., Google Travel) for seamless integration.

Integrate Google Maps: Display the locations of selected attractions to enhance the user experience
